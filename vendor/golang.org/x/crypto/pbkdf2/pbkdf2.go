Package pbkdf2 implements the key derivation function PBKDF2 as defined in RFC
2898 / PKCS #5 v2.0.

A key derivation function is useful when encrypting data based on a password
or any other not-fully-random data. It uses a pseudorandom function to derive
a secure encryption key based on the password.

While v2.0 of the standard defines only one pseudorandom function to use,
HMAC-SHA1, the drafted v2.1 specification allows use of all five FIPS Approved
Hash Functions SHA-1, SHA-224, SHA-256, SHA-384 and SHA-512 for HMAC. To
choose, you can pass the `New` functions from the different SHA packages to
pbkdf2.Key.

// Key derives a key from the password, salt and iteration count, returning a
// []byte of length keylen that can be used as cryptographic key. The key is
// derived based on the method described as PBKDF2 with the HMAC variant using
// the supplied hash function.
//
// For example, to use a HMAC-SHA-1 based PBKDF2 key derivation function, you
// can get a derived key for e.g. AES-256 (which needs a 32-byte key) by
// doing:
//
// 	dk := pbkdf2.Key([]byte("some password"), salt, 4096, 32, sha1.New)
//
// Remember to get a good random salt. At least 8 bytes is recommended by the
// RFC.
//
// Using a higher iteration count will increase the cost of an exhaustive
// search but will also make derivation proportionally slower.
