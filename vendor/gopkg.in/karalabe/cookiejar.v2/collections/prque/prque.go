// Package prque implements a priority queue data structure supporting arbitrary
// value types and float priorities.
//
// The reasoning behind using floats for the priorities vs. ints or interfaces
// was larger flexibility without sacrificing too much performance or code
// complexity.
//
// If you would like to use a min-priority queue, simply negate the priorities.
//
// Internally the queue is based on the standard heap package working on a
// sortable version of the block based stack.
