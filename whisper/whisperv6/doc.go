/*
Package whisper implements the Whisper protocol (version 6).

Whisper combines aspects of both DHTs and datagram messaging systems (e.g. UDP).
As such it may be likened and compared to both, not dissimilar to the
matter/energy duality (apologies to physicists for the blatant abuse of a
fundamental and beautiful natural principle).

Whisper is a pure identity-based messaging system. Whisper provides a low-level
(non-application-specific) but easily-accessible API without being based upon
or prejudiced by the low-level hardware attributes and characteristics,
particularly the notion of singular endpoints.
